# Third-party notices

whisp-carrier itself is MIT licensed (see `LICENSE`). This file lists everything
else that ships inside a built distribution, with its origin and licence.

Scope: the PyInstaller `onedir` build produced by `whisp_carrier.spec`, i.e. the
contents of `dist/whisp-carrier/` (2.24 GB, of which roughly 1.87 GB is the
NVIDIA CUDA libraries CTranslate2 loads). Running from source pulls the same
Python packages from your environment and additionally enables model conversion;
only the bundled `ffmpeg.exe` is specific to the build.

The spec also produces a separate AMD ROCm build as
`dist-amd/whisp-carrier-amd/` when the official ROCm CTranslate2 wheel is
installed. The two packages never mix CTranslate2 backends. The AMD build adds
the hipBLAS/rocBLAS/rocSOLVER/hipBLASLt runtime, architecture kernel data and
their four `LICENSE.*.txt` notices; `amdhip64_7.dll` is supplied by the user's
AMD driver and is not redistributed.

**PyTorch is no longer bundled (since 0.9.1).** Inference runs on CTranslate2 and
the default VAD is a native library called through `ctypes`, so nothing on the
normal path imported it; it accounted for 4.27 GB of the previous 4.78 GB build.
The CUDA libraries below are still taken out of the `torch` wheel at build time,
because that is where this project's build environment has them, but the `torch`
Python package itself is not redistributed. Running from source still uses torch
if it is installed (it is needed for the `silero_v3` / `silero_v4` / `silero_v5`
VAD backends, which the exe therefore does not provide).

Regenerating this list is described at the end.

## 1. ffmpeg (separate executable)

`ffmpeg.exe` ships in `_internal/` and is invoked as a child process by
`audio_filter.py` and `vad.py`. It is not linked into the executable.

| | |
|---|---|
| Version | FFmpeg `n8.1.2-44-g7c533d0f86-20260820` |
| Licence | **LGPL v3 or later** (`--enable-version3`, without `--enable-gpl`) |
| Build provider | [BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds) |
| Upstream project | [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) |
| Source code | https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg (tag `n8.1.2`); build recipe at https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds |
| Licence text | shipped as `LICENSE.ffmpeg.txt` beside the executable |
| SHA-256 | `8ee152edc79f7ba99969b7fb590cfde438b46cb383952dec87e754db83788572` |

GPL-only and non-free components are disabled in this build (no libx264,
libx265, libxvid, libxavs2, libdavs2, librubberband, libvidstab, frei0r,
libfdk-aac or AviSynth). `whisp_carrier.spec` reads the `configuration:` line of
the binary at build time and aborts if `--enable-gpl` or `--enable-nonfree` is
present, so a GPL build cannot end up here by accident. The hash above is
pinned in the spec and reported on every build.

FFmpeg does not distribute Windows binaries itself; ffmpeg.org points to
third-party build providers, of which BtbN is one. This is therefore a binary
from a provider FFmpeg refers people to, not one signed by the FFmpeg project.
Full provenance, including verification against the publisher's
`checksums.sha256` and the GitHub release metadata, is in
`_tools/ffmpeg/PROVENANCE.txt`.

---

## 2. Native runtime libraries

These arrive inside the `torch`, `ctranslate2` and `soundfile` wheels rather
than being fetched separately. They dominate the size of the distribution.

The CUDA entries are the ones CTranslate2 actually loads. `whisp_carrier.spec`
copies them out of the `torch` wheel's `lib/` directory by name and drops the
rest, so **cuFFT, cuRAND, cuSOLVER and cuSPARSE are no longer redistributed** —
they were only there because torch used them. They sit at the root of
`_internal/` rather than under `torch/lib/`, because the directory that used to
be added to the DLL search path was added by `torch/__init__.py`.

| Audio separation models | No | Downloaded by `audio-separator` on demand | Varies per model; check before redistributing output |

No model weights are included in the executable.

## 4. Python packages

This is the build environment, not the shipped set. Several entries are
deliberately excluded from the exe and therefore not redistributed:
`torch`, `torchaudio`, `silero-vad`, `transformers`, `audio-separator`,
`openai-whisper` and the packages they pulled in. See section 6.

Some entries are only partially present. PyInstaller stores pure-Python modules
in the PYZ archive and includes only what the import graph reaches, so
`audio-separator` and `stable-ts` contribute their top-level `__init__` without
the rest of the package (their features need `WHISP_CARRIER_FULL=1`; see
section 6). They are listed anyway, because some of their code does ship.

`pyannote.audio` is excluded and confirmed absent from the archive.

## 5. Copyleft components

Everything above is permissively licensed except the following. None is
statically linked into whisp-carrier's own code.

| Component | Licence | How it is used | Obligation |
|---|---|---|---|
| ffmpeg | LGPL-3.0-or-later | Separate process | Ship the licence text (done: `LICENSE.ffmpeg.txt`) and point at the sources (done: section 1). Users may replace the binary. |
| libsndfile | LGPL-2.1-or-later | Dynamic library loaded by `soundfile` | Licence text and source availability: https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile |
| PyInstaller bootloader | GPL-2.0-or-later **with the bootloader exception** | Compiled into `whisp-carrier.exe` as the startup stub | The exception exists precisely so that a frozen application can be distributed under its own terms, so MIT code stays MIT. Source and licence: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/blob/develop/COPYING.txt |
| certifi | MPL-2.0 | CA bundle, data only | Source availability for the file itself; no effect on surrounding code |
| tqdm | MPL-2.0 AND MIT | Imported library | As above |

None of these makes the distribution GPL. That would have happened with a GPL
build of ffmpeg, which is why the build now refuses one. The PyInstaller
bootloader is the only GPL-derived code physically inside the exe, and its
exception is written for exactly this case.

`python-soxr` (LGPL-2.1-or-later) was present in earlier builds through
`librosa`. Excluding the conversion path removed `librosa`, and with it soxr;
it is no longer shipped.

---

## 6. What the exe deliberately cannot do

Not defects. Each is a packaging decision, and each reports itself clearly at
runtime rather than failing obscurely.

**Model conversion.** `transformers` is excluded, so the exe cannot convert a
transformers-format model to CTranslate2. Asking for `-m anime-whisper` exits 2
with instructions to convert once using the script version and then pass the
converted directory. Built-in sizes and CTranslate2 models are unaffected. The
division of labour is intentional: the exe is the normal path, and the script
version is what you use for anime-whisper — which measured 17pt worse than
large-v3 on this project's own test set, so little is lost.

Note that `ctranslate2.converters` must *not* be excluded even though it is
part of the same feature: `ctranslate2/__init__.py` imports it unconditionally,
so excluding it breaks `import ctranslate2` and the exe dies on startup. Only
`transformers` is excluded, which is safe because
`converters/transformers.py` guards its own imports with `try/except
ImportError`.

**Vocal extraction.** `--ff_vocal_extract` needs `audio-separator`, which is
excluded from every build including `WHISP_CARRIER_FULL=1`. It was bundled once:
the package itself packaged correctly, then failed at runtime inside scipy with
"The `scipy` install you are using seems to be broken ... please try
reinstalling" — advice that sends the user to repair an installation that is not
broken. `audio_filter._load_separator` now reports the actual reason and points
at the script version. Nothing measurable is lost, because every accuracy figure
this project reports was produced without any `--ff_*` filter.

Excluding it also removes what it pulled in: `librosa`, `onnx`, `opencv-python`,
`pandas`, `scikit-learn` and `python-soxr` — the last of which was the only
LGPL-licensed Python package in the distribution.

**Realignment.** `--realign` needs `stable-ts`, which the default build omits.
`WHISP_CARRIER_FULL=1` includes it and `--realign` was verified working in that
variant.

**External VAD backends.** `--vad_method pyannote_v3` / `pyannote_onnx_v3` are
unavailable because `pyannote.audio` is excluded on purpose (it drags in
pytorch-lightning and speechbrain, and measured worse than the built-in silero).
`vad._missing_backend` says so explicitly.

**The torch-based silero backends.** `--vad_method silero_v3` / `silero_v4` /
`silero_v5` need `torch`, `torchaudio` and the `silero-vad` package, none of
which is bundled since 0.9.1. Dropping them removed 4.27 GB, and they lost to
the default TEN VAD on all fifteen reference recordings.

The built-in names are unaffected and stay available: `--vad_method
silero_v5_fw` / `silero_v6_fw` run faster-whisper's own Silero v6 ONNX through
`onnxruntime` and never touch torch. `vad._missing_backend` names the built-in
alternative when one of the torch-based backends is asked for.

Build `WHISP_CARRIER_WITH_TORCH=1` to get them back in a frozen build, which is
what to use when re-measuring silero. `WHISP_CARRIER_FULL=1` implies it, because
stable-ts needs torch too.

---

## Regenerating this list

Two sources have to be combined, because neither is complete on its own:

1. `dist/whisp-carrier/_internal/*.dist-info` plus the top-level directories
   there. Covers anything with a compiled extension or data files.
2. `build/whisp_carrier/PYZ-00.toc`, which lists the pure-Python modules that
   went into the archive. Without this, tqdm, rich, certifi and similar are
   missed entirely — they have no directory under `_internal`.

Match those names against the installed environment's metadata
(`importlib.metadata`) to recover versions and licences, since PyInstaller only
copies `dist-info` for packages that need it at runtime (7 of them here).

Also re-check the root of `_internal` and `ctranslate2` for native libraries
(the CUDA DLLs moved there when torch stopped being bundled; there is no
`torch/lib` any more, and the spec prints the list it kept), `_internal`
for `ffmpeg.exe`, and `_tools/ffmpeg/PROVENANCE.txt` for the bundled ffmpeg's
provenance. Grep the TOCs directly to confirm an exclusion actually took
effect; a spec `excludes` entry that never matched fails silently.

One component appears in neither source: **the PyInstaller bootloader**, which is
compiled into `whisp-carrier.exe` itself rather than sitting in `_internal` or the
PYZ archive. It was missing from this file until 2026-08-23 for that reason. It is
also the only GPL-derived code in the distribution, so it is worth carrying
forward by hand.
