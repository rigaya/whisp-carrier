# whisp-carrier

[日本語](README.md) | **English**

A faster-whisper CLI for NVIDIA CUDA and AMD ROCm.
Drop-in replacement for Faster-Whisper-XXL, built on open-source components.

**This is the manual for the distributed exe build.** Running it from Python is a
development build with no guarantees; its setup lives in `HANDOVER.md`. What the
exe cannot do is listed [below](#what-the-exe-build-cannot-do).

> The Japanese [README.md](README.md) is the fuller document: it also carries the
> complete option reference, the Amatsukaze field examples and the caveat list.
> `HANDOVER.md` holds the design decisions, `MEASUREMENTS.md` the raw
> measurements and `STATUS.md` where the project currently stands. All three are
> Japanese only (its commands are copy-pasteable regardless).

## Features

- **RTX 5090 native** — CTranslate2 on CUDA 12.8 / sm_120 in float16, with no
  compatibility fallback and no need for `-ct float32`
- **AMD ROCm package** — a separate Windows CTranslate2 ROCm build targeting
  RDNA3, RDNA3.5 and RDNA4 in float16; exact gfx targets and validation status
  are listed below
- **Amatsukaze compatible** — same CLI interface as faster-whisper-xxl.exe
- **Model aliases** — `-m anime-whisper` for Japanese anime dialogue; any Hugging Face
  Whisper fine-tune is converted to CTranslate2 on first use
- **TEN VAD by default** (Apache-2.0) — 19.0% -> **15.5%** whole-region CER over nine
  24-minute episodes and 30.8% -> **21.6%** over four children's programmes, better on
  12 of the 13 files rescored under the same conditions. The built-in silero paths are
  still selectable with `--vad_method`
- **Hallucination loop prevention** — segments that are one phrase or character
  repeated are dropped, which measured 24.3% -> 22.0% CER against ARIB captions
  on nine TV recordings (measured under the silero default and the pre-fix scoring
  script; `--loop_filter false` to keep them)
- **Vocal extraction** — MelBand-Roformer (SOTA quality) and MDX Kim_Vocal_2
- **Audio filters** — loudnorm, bandpass, FFT denoise, noise gate, etc.
- **Subtitle formatting** — sentence splitting, line width and count limits, Japanese kinsoku, re-timing from word timestamps
- **YAML profiles** — switch settings from a config file without touching the caller's options
- **Multiple output formats** — SRT, VTT, JSON, TXT, TSV, LRC

## Getting started

- Windows 10/11 (x64)
- NVIDIA package: NVIDIA RTX GPU with a CUDA 12.8+ driver
- AMD package: Windows 11, a supported Radeon GPU and a current HIP 7 driver
- **No Python, CUDA/HIP SDK or ffmpeg needed** (an LGPL ffmpeg is bundled)

### AMD GPU targets

The AMD package contains rocBLAS and hipBLASLt kernels for the gfx targets below.
“Targeted” means that the required gfx kernels are present in the package; it does
not mean that every listed GPU has been tested. The gfx name reported by the driver
must appear in this table.

| GPU generation | Bundled gfx targets | Typical product family | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| RDNA3 | `gfx1100`, `gfx1101`, `gfx1102` | Radeon RX 7000 family | **RX 7900 XT (`gfx1100`) tested** |
| RDNA3.5 | `gfx1150`, `gfx1151` | Matching integrated Radeon GPUs in Ryzen AI 300 / Ryzen AI Max | Not tested |
| RDNA4 | `gfx1200`, `gfx1201` | Radeon RX 9000 family | Tested on RX 9060 XT |

RDNA2 `gfx103x` and any gfx target not listed above are outside this package's
supported target set. A `gfx1036` integrated GPU was enumerated by ROCm during
testing but could not run this CTranslate2/kernel combination. For an untested GPU,
compare its `rocminfo` gfx name with the table instead of relying on the marketing
product name alone.

Verified environments:

- Windows exe: CUDA RTX 2070 / RTX 4080; AMD RX 7900 XT / RX 9060 XT
- Linux venv: CUDA RTX 2070 / RTX 4080 (WSL2); AMD RX 9060 XT

The NVIDIA and AMD builds are **separate packages**. They can coexist on one PC,
but must be extracted into different directories. Their `ctranslate2.dll` files
have the same name and are mutually exclusive, so combining both backends in one
package would make DLL selection fragile. The AMD executable is
`whisp-carrier-amd.exe`.

> Sequential inference is the default on both CUDA and AMD; pass `--batched` to opt in to batching.
> Do not use `--realign` or
> `--vad_device cuda` in this build; the default TEN VAD already runs on the CPU.

> **If the GPU cannot be used, this does not stop with an error — it keeps going on the CPU.**
> With a driver older than CUDA 12.8, or no NVIDIA GPU, it falls back to
> `device=cpu` / `compute=int8` and carries on. **It works, but not at a usable speed.**
> If a run never seems to finish rather than failing, check this first. CPU speed has not
> been measured, so the timings under "Measured accuracy" do not apply to it.
>
> The `device=` line printed at startup tells you which one you got:
>
> ```
> ctranslate2 4.8.1 | backend=cuda | device=cuda | compute=float16  <- NVIDIA
> ctranslate2 4.8.1 | backend=rocm | device=cuda | compute=float16  <- AMD
> ctranslate2 4.8.1 | backend=rocm | device=cpu | compute=int8      <- no GPU
> ```
>
> Adding `--checkcuda` to the executable from either package reports the same
> thing as a number (`0` means no GPU is visible).

Unpack the archive and run `whisp-carrier.exe` for NVIDIA or
`whisp-carrier-amd.exe` for AMD. The examples below use the NVIDIA filename.
`LICENSE`, `LICENSE.ffmpeg.txt`,
`LICENSE.ten-vad.*.txt`, `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and
`whisp-carrier.yaml.example` sit next to it; the AMD package also includes
four ROCm runtime `LICENSE.*.txt` files. The config file is optional.

## Usage

```powershell
# Basic
whisp-carrier.exe "video.mp4" -m large-v3 -o source -pp

# Standard subtitle formatting (42 chars, 2 lines) / Japanese (16 chars, 2 lines)
whisp-carrier.exe "video.mp4" -l en --standard -o source
whisp-carrier.exe "video.mp4" -l ja --standard_asia -o source

# Widening the beam is not an upgrade here: measured equal or worse than the
# default 5 in 8 of 9 episodes. Left as an example of a knob, not a recommendation.
whisp-carrier.exe "video.mp4" -m large-v3 --beam_size 10 --best_of 10 -o source -pp
```

## Models

`--model` takes a built-in Whisper size, an alias, a local directory or a Hugging
Face repo id. Run `--list_models` for the alias table.

```powershell
# A built-in size
whisp-carrier.exe "video.mp4" -m large-v3 -l ja -o source

# An already converted directory (converting itself needs the script version)
whisp-carrier.exe "video.mp4" -m _models\ct2-litagin-anime-whisper-float16 -o source
```

| Alias | Source | License | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------|-------|
| `anime-whisper` | [litagin/anime-whisper](https://huggingface.co/litagin/anime-whisper) | MIT | kotoba-whisper-v2.0 fine-tuned on 5,300h of anime-style acted dialogue. Reported CER 13.0 against 16.5 for whisper-large-v3 on out-of-training visual novel audio. **On recorded TV anime here it loses badly to large-v3**: 50.7% against 27.4% whole-region CER under identical settings, on the material most favourable to it. Inference is about 2x faster. |
| `kotoba-v2` | [kotoba-tech/kotoba-whisper-v2.0-faster](https://huggingface.co/kotoba-tech/kotoba-whisper-v2.0-faster) | Apache-2.0 | General Japanese, distilled from large-v3. Already CTranslate2, so nothing is converted. |

An alias also carries the option defaults that model wants. `anime-whisper`
selects `--language ja` and `--no_repeat_ngram_size 5`, and warns if an initial
prompt is passed, which is known to send it into hallucination loops. Anything
set on the command line or in the YAML file wins, and every decision is echoed
on `[MODEL]` lines:

```
[MODEL] alias 'anime-whisper' -> litagin/anime-whisper (MIT)
[MODEL] using converted model: ...\_models\ct2-litagin-anime-whisper-float16
[MODEL]   language = 'ja'  (default for anime-whisper)
[MODEL]   no_repeat_ngram_size = 5  (default for anime-whisper)
```

### Conversion

faster-whisper only loads CTranslate2 models, so a transformers-format source is
converted once into `_models/ct2-<name>-<quantization>/` next to the script (or
under `--model_dir`). The conversion needs `transformers`, downloads the weights
through the normal Hugging Face cache, and is skipped on every later run. Use
`--reconvert` to redo it, for example after switching `--compute_type`.

Two details are handled during conversion because getting them wrong fails
quietly rather than loudly:

- **tokenizer.json** is generated when the source does not ship one. Without it
  faster-whisper silently falls back to the whisper-tiny tokenizer and produces
  wrong text with no error.
- **alignment heads** are validated against the real decoder depth. Distilled
  models inherit their teacher's head list, so `--word_timestamps` would index a
  decoder layer that does not exist and kill the process with no traceback.

### Conversion needs the script version

The exe does not bundle `transformers`. Conversion is a one-off step, and
shipping it would add a few hundred MB and an untested frozen code path to the
distribution. **To use anime-whisper, convert once with the development build and
hand the resulting `_models/ct2-*` directory to the exe**; the procedure is in
`HANDOVER.md`.

**Passing `-m anime-whisper` straight to the exe prints those instructions and
exits 2.** Built-in sizes, CTranslate2 models and already converted directories
all work as usual. The full list of what differs is in
[what the exe build cannot do](#what-the-exe-build-cannot-do).

## Exit codes

Meant to be checked when driving this from a batch script or Amatsukaze.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Every file succeeded |
| `1` | **One or more files failed**, or no input was found |
| `2` | Startup error (config file, model resolution, VAD setup) |

With several inputs, one failure does not stop the rest. The count and the names
of the failed files go to stderr at the end and the exit code becomes 1.
`[whisp-carrier] All done.` is printed only when everything succeeded.

If an audio filter (`--ff_*`) fails, that file is counted as failed and no
transcript is written for it. A run that could not apply the requested filter
does not silently fall back to unfiltered audio.

## Config File (Profiles)

Editing the caller's extra-options string for every experiment is tedious, so
settings can live in a YAML file instead. Rename `whisp-carrier.yaml.example` to
`whisp-carrier.yaml` and place it next to `whisp_carrier.py` (or next to the exe).
It is picked up automatically, so **the calling application needs no changes**.

```yaml
override: true            # let this file win over command line options
active_profile: anime     # switch settings by editing this one line

beam_size: 10             # flat keys apply to every profile
best_of: 10

profiles:
  anime:
    language: ja
    standard_asia: true
```

Keys are the `--help` option names without the leading `--`. With
`override: false` (the code default) the file only fills in options the command
line did not set. Every applied value is echoed on `[CONFIG]` lines so results
can be traced back to the settings that produced them. An unknown key is an
error rather than a warning, since a silently ignored typo would invalidate a
comparison run.

Related options: `--config PATH`, `--no_config`, `--profile NAME`,
`--config_override`.

## Amatsukaze Integration

1. Set whisper path to: `C:\Users\<you>\whisp-carrier\whisp-carrier.exe`
2. **Leave the whisper-option field empty.** The defaults are exactly the
   configuration the figures above were measured with: TEN VAD at 0.75,
   `beam_size` / `best_of` 5, clip routing, loop suppression on.
   Add `--standard_asia` if you want the subtitles broken into 16-character
   two-line cues, and `--language ja` if short split fragments are being
   misdetected. Model and output format are supplied by Amatsukaze.

   **Set whisper-model to `large-v3` explicitly.** Its `自動` / auto setting passes
   `-m large-v3-turbo` (verified), and turbo keeps large-v3's encoder while cutting
   the decoder from 32 layers to 4. Everything this project is measured on is
   decoder-side work: loop hallucinations, segments running past 30s, and the
   timestamp tokens that place each cue. `condition_on_previous_text` is off here
   by design, so there is no carried context to recover with. turbo is not
   measured against the reference set, so the figures above would not apply.
   Passing turbo or a distil model prints a `[MODEL] NOTE:` at startup.
   The `未指定` / unspecified setting omits `-m` altogether, which lets a `model:`
   entry in the config file apply without needing `override`.
3. **Do not pass `--beam_size 10 --best_of 10`.** An earlier revision of this
   document recommended it; measured over the same nine episodes it was equal to
   or worse than beam 5 in 8 of 9 files (22.0% -> 22.3% CER) for 2.8% more time.
   Clear it if it is already in the field.
4. A config file is optional. `whisp-carrier.yaml` next to the exe with
   `override: true` lets you switch settings without touching Amatsukaze, which
   is convenient for A/B runs but not needed for normal use.

## Scope: opening/ending themes and singing are out of scope

**The target is dialogue in the episode body. Themes, insert songs and singing
scenes are out of scope, and not suppressing them is not guaranteed either.**
Under some conditions the output does contain lyric-like text.

This is shared behaviour across Whisper-based transcription, not something
specific to this project. Characters produced inside the same song windows on
the same material:

| Implementation | Characters inside song windows |
|---|---|
| whisp-carrier (current default, TEN VAD) | 2,274 |
| Faster-Whisper-XXL r245.4 | 630 |
| whisp-carrier (previous default, silero) | 54 |

The old silero default produced almost nothing there, but that was a **detection
miss rather than a feature**, and the same miss dropped dialogue as well.
Recovering that dialogue with TEN VAD raises the song-window output as a
side effect.

**No song filter is shipped.** Dropping those regions was measured and made
accuracy worse (whole-region CER 15.5% -> 16.1%). Some broadcasts do caption
their songs and the practice is not consistent, so a mechanical filter also
removes wanted captions.

If lyrics are unwanted, deleting the cues for those time ranges afterwards is
the reliable route. The `[VAD]` log lines are the signal to look at.

Separately from singing, **Whisper emits stock closing phrases such as
「ご視聴ありがとうございました」("thank you for watching") over non-speech.** It is
the model producing a high-frequency training phrase against silence, and
Faster-Whisper-XXL does it too. The result is a subtitle line landing on the
opening, the ending, the sponsor credits or a trailer. Broadcast captions are
empty there, so it barely shows in CER and is completely visible on screen.

**These are dropped by default** (`--filler_filter`, default `true`). A segment is
discarded only when the phrase accounts for the whole of it; **partial matches are
left alone**, because those take real dialogue with them. Detection always runs and
every hit is logged, so turning the filter off still tells you what matched.
Over nine 24-minute episodes: 16.1% to 15.5%, better on 14 of 15 files, no
regressions, and zero false positives across 11,967 reference cues.

> **Take care if you record variety shows or drama.** A host may genuinely say
> "thank you for watching" to close the programme, which is exactly where this
> fires. Pass `--filler_filter false` if that matters to you.
> **The default was decided on fifteen Japanese TV anime recordings and has not
> been measured on any other genre.**

## What the exe build cannot do

**The exe is the supported path.** Transcription, VAD, loop suppression, the
over-30s repair, subtitle formatting and the config file all work there. Three
options need the development build, which carries no guarantees and is documented
in `HANDOVER.md`. Each of them says so when invoked rather than failing obscurely.

| Option | exe | script | Reason it is not bundled |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| `-m anime-whisper` (any transformers-format model) | no | yes | `transformers` is not bundled; convert once with the script version, then pass the converted directory |
| `--ff_vocal_extract` | no | yes | `audio-separator` is not bundled. Bundling it packaged cleanly but failed at runtime inside scipy, reporting a broken scipy installation that was not broken |
| `--realign` | no | yes | `stable-ts` is not in the default build; `WHISP_CARRIER_FULL=1` includes it. It is skipped anyway whenever subtitle formatting is on, which the recommended settings enable |
| `--vad_method pyannote_v3` / `pyannote_onnx_v3` | no | no | `pyannote.audio` is excluded on purpose: it pulls in pytorch-lightning and speechbrain, and measured worse than the built-in silero VAD |
| `--vad_method silero_v3` / `silero_v4` / `silero_v5` | no | yes | `torch` is not bundled as of 0.9.1. It was 4.27 GB on its own, and these backends lost to the default TEN VAD on every material group measured. The built-in names (`silero_v5_fw`, `silero_v6_fw`) run through onnxruntime and still work in the exe |

**None of this affects accuracy.** Every figure this project reports was measured
without any `--ff_*` filter, on `large-v3`, through the default TEN VAD path,
and none of the three appear in it.

## Architecture

```
whisp_carrier.py            — Main CLI, transcription logic, output writers
audio_filter.py             — ffmpeg filters + vocal extraction (MDX/Roformer)
vad.py                      — External VAD backends: ten (default), silero,
                              precomputed, pyannote, auditok, webrtc
loop_filter.py              — Detects and drops looping output
subtitle_format.py          — Subtitle splitting, wrapping, re-timing, sanitizing
whisp_models.py             — Model aliases and CTranslate2 conversion
whisp_config.py             — YAML config file / profiles
whisp_vad_patch.py          — Swaps the built-in VAD model / segment source
whisp-carrier.bat           — Launcher for Amatsukaze compatibility (script version)
whisp-carrier.yaml.example  — Sample config file
whisp_carrier.spec          — PyInstaller build; ffmpeg licence check lives here
eval/                       — Accuracy harness; independent of the CLI, not in the exe
THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md      — Everything bundled, with licences
```

`HANDOVER.md` has the fuller version of this, together with the dependency table
and the reasoning behind each default. It is Japanese only.

## Measured accuracy

**Scored against ARIB broadcast captions on 15 Japanese TV recordings**, default
settings on both sides, no audio filters, singing excluded from scoring.

| Material | Files | Reference chars | whisp-carrier (default) | Faster-Whisper-XXL r245.4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 24-minute episodes | 9 | 35,036 | **15.5%** | 20.5% |
| Children's programmes | 4 | 16,704 | **21.6%** | 33.5% |
| Marathon broadcast (5h22m) | 1 | 37,987 | **15.6%** | not measured |
| Marathon broadcast (4h52m) | 1 | 50,255 | **13.8%** | not measured |

Figures are whole-region CER (character error rate, lower is better).
**No single number describes this.** Per file the spread is 8.0% to 28.8%,
and it tracks the content: 8.0 to 13.8% for dialogue-driven shows,
22 to 25% for children's programmes, 28.8% for the worst case
(a series where speech covers only 23% of the runtime). Episodes of the same
series differ too: one scored 16.0% and another 26.7%.

**The error is mostly missed speech rather than wrong text.** Over the nine
episodes, 86.6% of the reference was recovered and 90.8% of the produced text
matched it. The weaker files are not less precise, they output less.

Structural differences, which matter more in practice for subtitles:

| | whisp-carrier | Faster-Whisper-XXL r245.4 |
|---|---|---|
| Segments longer than 30s (nine episodes) | **0** | 9, totalling 602s |
| Long segments carrying almost no text | 1 | 15 |
| Hallucination loop characters left (nine episodes) | **35** | 53 |
| Runs on RTX 5090 at defaults | **yes** (float16) | no, needs `-ct float32` (~2x slower) |
| One 24-minute episode | 70-100s | 175s |
| One 5h22m broadcast | 1214s (6.3% of runtime) | not measured |

There is no degradation on long material: the two marathon broadcasts scored
15.6% and **13.8%**, the latter being the best result across the whole corpus.

### On RTX 50-series, running with no extra options is itself the difference

**Calling Faster-Whisper-XXL r245.4 from Amatsukaze with no extra options fails**
(measured on an RTX 5090):

```
Detecting language using up to the first 30 seconds.
  File "faster_whisper\transcribe.py", line 1719, in encode
RuntimeError: cuBLAS failed with status CUBLAS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED
AMT [warn] Whisper字幕生成に失敗: Exception thrown at Subtitle.cpp:94
```

It dies in the **first encoder pass**, during language detection, so it does not
depend on the material, on VRAM, or on the model size. Adding `-ct float32` to
the options field makes it work, at roughly half the speed.

**Amatsukaze does not stop there: it carries on encoding.** The recording
finishes with no subtitles, and nothing but the log says why.

**whisp-carrier runs that same path with no extra options**, which is why the
Amatsukaze section here says to leave the option field empty.

Scope: verified with r245.4 (the free build) on an RTX 5090. All Blackwell parts
are sm_120, so a 5080 or 5070 should behave the same, but that was not measured.
A CTranslate2 build with sm_120 support would presumably resolve it.

### How the comparison was set up

**Faster-Whisper-XXL ran at its defaults, and those defaults are the recommendation.**
The [upstream README](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/blob/main/README.md)
states that its defaults are already tuned for transcribing movies and publishes no
separate list of recommended options; the usage examples only add `--sentence`,
`--standard` or `--batch_recursive`. (Summarised rather than quoted, for licence
compliance.)

**Those defaults are not bare.** Three hallucination countermeasures are on out of
the box.

| Setting | Faster-Whisper-XXL r245.4 default | whisp-carrier default |
|---|---|---|
| VAD | on (silero) | on (**TEN VAD**) |
| `vad_min_silence_duration_ms` / `vad_speech_pad_ms` | 3000 / 900 | 3000 / 900 (adopted from upstream) |
| `beam_size` / `best_of` | 5 / 5 | 5 / 5 |
| `patience` | 2.0 | 2.0 |
| `condition_on_previous_text` | **True** | **False** (measured, see below) |
| Known-hallucination list | **on** | no equivalent |
| large-v3 pseudo-VAD threshold offsets | **on** | no equivalent |
| Prompt re-injection / duplicate-prompt suppression | **on** | no equivalent |
| Audio filters (`--ff_*`) | all off | not used |
| Subtitle formatting presets | off | `standard_asia: true` recommended |
| Loop suppression | — | **on** (no upstream equivalent) |

The full command lines were:

```powershell
# Faster-Whisper-XXL r245.4
faster-whisper-xxl.exe <wav> -m large-v3 -ct float32 -f json --language ja --beep_off

# whisp-carrier (defaults; --no_config keeps any config file out of the run)
python whisp_carrier.py <wav> -m large-v3 -f json --no_config --beep_off
```

**Two departures, both in XXL's favour or neutral.** `-ct float32` is unavoidable
because float16 crashes in cuBLAS on an RTX 5090; it is the same weights, so
accuracy is if anything better (at roughly half the speed). `--language ja` was
passed explicitly; on this implementation naming the language did not change a
single segment, since detection already returned ja at 92-100%.

**Matching the formatting would not change the headline figure.** Formatting adds
line breaks and cue splits, and scoring strips all whitespace from *both* sides,
so whole-region CER is unaffected. Per-30s-block CER does move with formatting,
and both sides ran unformatted there.

**Why `condition_on_previous_text` is False here.** Enabling it was measured:
coverage on a low-speech-density episode fell from 59.7% to 21.3%, inference took
5.9x longer, and output stopped at 18:16 of a 30:00 runtime. The upstream default
cannot simply be borrowed.

**Not measured:** XXL with audio filters (`--ff_rnndn_sh` and friends) or
`--batched`. Both are off by default and absent from the author's recommendations,
and this project has settled on not using filters, so enabling them on one side
only would make the comparison asymmetric.

`HANDOVER.md` documents the corpus, the metrics and how they are computed;
[MEASUREMENTS.md](MEASUREMENTS.md) carries the results themselves.

## Status

**Active — Evaluation phase.** Feedback welcome.

Amatsukaze integration is verified on the exe build. The same episode that is in
the measurement corpus was run through Amatsukaze in production and matched the
harness exactly: same VAD region count, same seconds of detected speech, same
segment count, same suppressed loop. The figures above are what that path
produces. **Only the exe build is supported**; running it from Python is a
development build with no guarantees.

The NVIDIA package bundles CUDA / cuDNN, the AMD package bundles hipBLAS, and
both bundle Intel OpenMP. On NVIDIA, only what CTranslate2 actually loads ships
— cuBLAS, cuDNN, NVRTC and nvJitLink — while cuFFT, cuRAND,
cuSOLVER and cuSPARSE were dropped in 0.9.1 because only torch used them. Their
redistribution terms are in THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md.

**0.9.1 halves the download.** The extracted build went from 4.78 GB to 2.24 GB
by not bundling PyTorch: inference runs on CTranslate2 and the default VAD is a
native library, so neither used it. Output is unchanged — byte for byte identical
to 0.9.0 on the same audio.

Inspired by [Faster-Whisper-XXL](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win) (Purfview), a
closed-source Whisper CLI. Its free build (r245.4) does not run on an RTX 5090 at its defaults --
`-ct float32` makes it work but runs about twice as slow as float16 -- and the Pro build that carries
the 50-series support is a non-public version for donators of £50 or more. whisp-carrier
reimplements equivalent functionality using only open-source components.
