    name; a module with that base name already in the process satisfies the

    Called only for device=cuda. Mapping the two files costs about a second, and
    on the GPU path that is not an extra second -- CTranslate2 maps the same
    files a moment later anyway. On CPU it would be pure waste.

    Absolute paths do not survive this trick: LoadLibrary with a full path to a

    On Windows, Python only uses UTF-8 for the console itself (3.6+ writes
    through the wide console API). As soon as the streams are a pipe or a file
    they fall back to the locale encoding, which is cp932 on a Japanese
    install. Measured here: isatty() -> 'utf-8', piped -> 'cp932'.

    That fallback is what broke the Amatsukaze logs. Amatsukaze decodes this
    process's output as UTF-8 unconditionally -- TranscodeManager.cpp sets
    `param.isUtf8Log = true` on both the synchronous and the parallel path, and
    ProcessThread.cpp then runs every line through
    `utf8ToString()` (CP_UTF8 -> UTF-16 -> CP_ACP). Feeding cp932 bytes into a
    UTF-8 decoder produced the mojibake we saw: 'ロック' went out as
    83 8D 83 62 83 4E and came back as '???b?N', the two trail bytes that
    happen to be ASCII ('b' = 0x62, 'N' = 0x4E) surviving.

    So the encoding was ours to fix all along. Setting it here also repairs
    every other line that quotes the source -- input paths, [OUT] paths, the
    live transcription preview -- none of which went through console_safe().

    PYTHONIOENCODING wins if the caller set it: eval/run.py relies on that, and

    Our own output is English on purpose, but some of it has to quote the
    source: the [LOOP] lines show the text that was discarded, and errors name
    the file that failed. Those are Japanese here.

    With _setup_console_encoding() in front of this, the streams are UTF-8 and
    the check below passes, so the Japanese goes out as-is and is readable in
    the Amatsukaze log. This used to escape unconditionally, which was the
    wrong fix for the right observation: the text really did arrive as '?', but
    because we were emitting cp932 into a UTF-8 reader, not because the reader
    was beyond our reach.

    The guard stays because it still earns its place, but the test is "are we
    writing UTF-8" rather than "can this encoding hold the character". Those
    differ, and the difference is the whole bug: cp932 represents 'ロック'
    perfectly well, so an encodability check passes and then the UTF-8 reader on
    the other end still garbles it. UTF-8 is the only encoding we know our
    consumer decodes, so anything else means the bytes are not ours to trust and
    \uXXXX is the safe form -- ugly, but reversible and never lossy.

    Reachable when PYTHONIOENCODING pins something narrower, which _setup_
    console_encoding() deliberately leaves alone. eval/ takes the same position
    for the same reason: raw glyphs in a cp932 pipe killed investigations with
