# which used to select it, no longer exists.

# Measured on the 0.9.0 build: _internal was 4.7 GB and torch was 4273 MB of it,
# of which 4004 MB is bundled CUDA. Nothing on the default path uses torch --
# inference is CTranslate2 (59 MB) and the default VAD is a native library
# reached with ctypes (1.3 MB) -- so that payload was being spent on the version
# banner and on the silero VAD backends, which lost to TEN VAD on all fifteen
# references.
#
# It cannot simply be excluded, because site-packages has no nvidia-* wheels and
# torch/lib is the only copy of cuBLAS and cuDNN on this machine; CTranslate2
# resolves them from there today. So the DLLs are picked out by name and torch
# itself is dropped, which keeps roughly 1.9 GB and discards roughly 2.3 GB
# (torch_cuda 981 MB, torch_cpu 244 MB, cusparse 362 MB, cufft 263 MB,
# cusolver 215+150 MB, curand 69 MB, the duplicate nvrtc .alt 83 MB).
#
# Adopted as the default on 2026-08-23. It shipped as opt-in first, on the
# reasoning that a packaging change of this size should not ride along invisibly
# with a bug fix -- which was the wrong way round: forgetting the variable
# silently produced a 4.8 GB archive.
